# FAQ:
>How to see amount of health from [Advanced Health System](https://github.com/deltamolfar/PublicE2/blob/main/misc/Advanced_Health_System.txt)?

Use any text screen/modular hud or just click C->RMB->Debug on that E2. E2 itself doesn't provide any graphical/chat announcements/info to make it portable inside any other contraptions, and as modular as possible.
